#marginalis


Written text has all sorts of non-linear tools, like writing or drawing in the mmargins. Marginalis implements a basic set of skeuomorphic jQuery tools to do some of these things.

1. Enforce 50-ish character lines, distraction free margins and a reasonable text size.
2. For a certain class of anchors links (<a name="whatever">), draw an arrow from the anchor to the referred-to element (#whatever).
3. Write tiny text in the margins where it refers to. For too-large text, show a clickable continuation, where the margin note expands and moves to the center. On click on the main text, center that again and shrink the margin note.


###TODO:
1. Fancy-pants drop caps
2. Pre-parse/POS-tag the text. Shrink and fade all words that aren't nouns and verbs. This would be an interesting experiment into the Strunk-and-White-ian claim that one should write with nouns and verbs, not adjectives or adverbs.
3. Visibly link marginalia with their referents.
  - Footnote-like superscripts to allow a marginalis to pertain to a sub-paragraph level element, or, 
  - Hide all but the referent of the mouseovered marginalis. (Requires repositioning the text.)
4. Cope with multiple marginalia pertaining to one element. (Don't have them cover each other up.)
5. Nested marginalia. (Yo dawg, I herd you liekd margin notes, so I put margin notes in your margin notes.)
6. When a margin note is clicked, center it. (Perhaps only for long margin notes)
5. Build a totally kick-ass kidpix-like palette of awesome animals, saints, angels, dragons and other margin-dwelling creatures to be pasted all willy-nilly throughout the user's page's margins. (Unfortunately, not really)
