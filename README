#marginalis


Written text has all sorts of non-linear tools, like writing or drawing in the mmargins. Marginalis implements a basic set of skeuomorphic jQuery tools to do some of these things.

1. Enforce 50-ish character lines, distraction free margins and a reasonable text size.
2. For a certain class of anchors links (<a name="whatever">), draw an arrow from the anchor to the referred-to element (#whatever).
3. Write tiny text in the margins where it refers to. For too-large text, show a clickable continuation, where the margin note expands and moves to the center. On click on the main text, center that again and shrink the margin note.

Fancy-pants drop caps
Build a totally kick-ass kidpix-like palette of awesome animals, saints, angels, dragons and other margin-dwelling creatures to be pasted all willy-nilly throughout the user's page's margins. (Unfortunately, not really)
